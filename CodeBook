2) data description
The row data was devided in a test and train set. the test set measure the activities of 9 persons and the train data for 21 persons. There are 6 activities measure using accelerometer and gyrometer. the activities are: laying, standing, walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting.
first the train data were merge together to have one data set.named data. then the mean and std were localised in the feature set. the feature set represent the variables name of the data frame data.Using the feature element representing mean and std, a new data frame was extracted from data data frame. the new data frame name is datameanstd. next the activities code was replace in actx column of datameanstd using gsub function. the data frame variable names were set using the function names() and the extracted elements of features contening mean or std.
using group_by and summarize_each, the data was group by subject and activity before being summarize.
the new data frame was giving the name stydidata.
